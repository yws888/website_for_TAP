# website_for_TAP
For the DARE TAP assessment

Technical Requirements:
1. Usage of ORM:

This site is built with Django, which has an Object-relational Mapper (ORM) that maps Python objects/classes (code) to relational database (SQL is used here) statements. The code for these objects is located in the models.py file.

2. Logging of all CRUD actions.



3. Explain the following in a README file.
a. Steps required to run your application.
b. Explain how you would deploy this app on a cloud environment (Bonus: How you would
do this with serverless components).
c. Explain security hardening techniques on a cloud environment.

You may include a section with the assumptions, interpretations you have made about the requirements above or notes on your architecture decisions.

Please provide instructions on how to run your source code locally on our laptop in the README
file.
